    "# Analysis of Seasonal Mortality in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernhard Klinger <klinger@btinternet.com>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In common with other countries more people in England & Wales die in winter than during other parts of the year. In addition, the number of excess winter deaths has historically varied significantly between years. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper outlines out how Python libraries could be used to analyse and explain the seasonal mortality pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regression model developed indicates that cold weather and flu vaccine effectiveness could explain most of the variation in excess winter mortality from 2011 to 2019.  "

    "### Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actual mortality and population data \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample dataset provided has been derived from provisional weekly death counts and regional population estimates for 2010 to 2019 as published on the website of the Office of National Statistics (ONS). As the seasonal mortality effects are most pronounced for older ages, we have limited the study to the population in England & Wales aged 65 years and older.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Winter mortality\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that mortality would be elevated in the period from December to April. December to February fall within the winter quarter and March to April within the spring quarter in our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Air frost days\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of air frost (AF) days has been selected to reflect the impact of cold weather on mortality. This metric could be a better indicator for cold waves than monthly mean temperature. Monthly data points for England and Wales have been sourced from the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-and-regional-series) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flu vaccine effectiveness \n",
    "\n",
    "Influenza related deaths are a significant contributor to winter mortality for older age groups. The effectiveness of flu vaccine in a particular year could therefore help to explain variations in excess mortality during the flu season. In our analysis, we have used a single data point per calendar year, the effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccines for all age groups. This data item was sourced from the [Center of Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm) website for 2009/2010 to 2014/2015 and from [Public Health England (PHE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/influenza-vaccine-effectiveness-seasonal-estimates) publications for 2015/2016 to date. \n",
