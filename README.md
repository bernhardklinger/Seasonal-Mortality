# Seasonal-Mortality

In common with other countries more people in England & Wales die in winter than during other parts of the year. In addition, the number of excess winter deaths has historically varied significantly between years.

This paper outlines out how Python libraries could be used to analyse and explain the seasonal mortality pattern.

The regression model developed indicates that cold weather and flu vaccine effectiveness could explain most of the variation in excess winter mortality from 2011 to 2019.
